     - line 22:
       - Am I supposed to run this once per chromosome or file pair?
       - where is the output created?
 - requested the 500k exome data file
   - Yanhua is on it ðŸ˜Ž (will prolly take couple days for the result)
 - went through the old readme, things are making a bit more sense
   - I think I am ready for QC with the 500k exome data now
