# Notes

Running list of all I have done & plan to do with this project

## 2022 10 25
- So we have the 500k exome data, but we do not know the extent of the QC procedures they applied to it
  - We know that they followed the OQFE protocol
  - after that we don't know if they did anything different


## 2022 07 27
 - We don't have the 500K exome data
 - We will not get the 500K exome data soon
   - UK Biobank have changed their data access policies
     - [July 22nd Data Access Policy](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/media/najcnoaz/access_064-uk-biobank-exome-release-faq_v11-1_final-002.pdf)
     - ![How do we access these files](./notes/20220727_notes_pic1.png)
     - It will be very expensive to acquire the 500K data now:
       - [Transactional Arrangements & Fees](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/enable-your-research/costs/transitional-arrangements-and-faqs)
     - ![Fee Access Structure](./notes/20220727_notes_pic2.png)
     - I think we can get away with 1500 pounds as I can qualify as student researcher
     - We need Tier 3 access as this is the one that has exome data
 - update: Liz knows about this & has assigned someone to get me the 500K data ASAP

 - started the github
 - began migrating some files from the depths of the drive
 - I have many Questions ðŸ˜µ
   - old_notes:
     - line 22:
       - Am I supposed to run this once per chromosome or file pair?
       - where is the output created?
 - requested the 500k exome data file
   - Yanhua is on it ðŸ˜Ž (will prolly take couple days for the result)
 - went through the old readme, things are making a bit more sense
   - I think I am ready for QC with the 500k exome data now
